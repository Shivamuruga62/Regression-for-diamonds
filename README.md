# Regression-for-diamonds
Diamonds Analyze diamonds by their cut, color, clarity, price, and other attributes;  Diamond price prediction based on their cut, colour, clarity, price . To building a simple Linear Regression model Have you ever asked yourself, how are diamonds priced?  Well, this article talks about the diamonds price prediction based on Their cut, colour, clarity &amp; other attributes and it also covers the building a simple linear regression mode.  Intro to Linear Regression:                   Linear Regression is one of the simplest algorithms in Machine Learning.  As per statistics, the term Regression is defined as a measure of the relation between an output variable  and the input variable(s),   hence, Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent (input) and dependent (output) variable. More generally, a linear model makes a prediction by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features, plus a bias  (also called the intercept) term. (Source) as shown in the below equation.                        ........let’s have a look into the variables &amp; their definitions.........  1. Price is in US dollars 2. Carat weight of the diamond 3. Cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) 4. color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best) 5. clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)) 6. x length in mm 7. y width in mm 8. z depth in m depth: The height of a diamond table: The width of the diamond’s table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter          ****Let’s get started to build the linear regression model based on the following steps**** Import Required Packages Load the dataset Perform the exploratory data analysis (EDA) Prepare the dataset for training Create a linear regression model Train the model to fit the data Make predictions using the trained model
